# Parallelization of Kmer Counting.

Hi there! With this code you can utilize ALL the cores on your system to count the occourance of kmers in a fasta file and find top N  of kmers that you decide.

# HOW TO USE
1) Download or clone this repository (this repository already includes the test file "humantest.fsa" that you can use to test this program).
2) Run the main2.py.
3) Alternativly you can download a fasta file which you will use it as an input for the program.
4) Then save and run again :-)!
